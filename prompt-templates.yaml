  security:
    name: Security-focused Review
    purpose: Identify security vulnerabilities and potential threats
    prompt: |
      Perform a comprehensive security analysis of the provided code.
      
      Focus on identifying:
      - Injection vulnerabilities (SQL injection, command injection, XSS, etc.)
      - Authentication and authorization weaknesses
      - Data validation issues
      - Session management flaws
      - Cryptographic implementation problems
      - Secure configuration concerns
      - Privilege escalation possibilities
      
      For each vulnerability identified:
      1. Explain the security risk and potential impact
      2. Provide specific code locations where the issue occurs
      3. Recommend practical mitigation strategies with code examples when appropriate
      4. Categorize severity as high/medium/low
    severityThreshold: high

  best-practices:
    name: Best Practices Review
    purpose: Ensure adherence to language-specific standards and patterns
    prompt: |
      Conduct a thorough review of the code against established best practices.
      
      Evaluate:
      - Proper use of language-specific idioms and conventions
      - Appropriate design patterns and architectural principles
      - Error handling and logging practices
      - Resource management and cleanup procedures
      - Performance implications of the implementation
      - Maintainability and extensibility considerations
      
      Provide constructive feedback including:
      - Specific recommendations for improvements
      - Alternative approaches where applicable
      - References to relevant documentation or standards
      - Priority level for each suggestion
    severityThreshold: medium

  style:
    name: Style and Formatting Review
    purpose: Ensure consistent formatting and naming conventions
    prompt: |
      Review the code for adherence to consistent style and formatting standards.
      
      Check for:
      - Naming conventions compliance (variables, functions, classes, etc.)
      - Consistent indentation and spacing
      - Appropriate commenting practices
      - Code organization and structure
      - Import/ordering consistency
      - Line length and file organization
      
      Suggestions should include:
      - Specific style guide references when applicable
      - Automated tooling recommendations for enforcement
      - Before/after examples for clarity
      - Differentiation between required fixes and optional improvements
    severityThreshold: low

  performance:
    name: Performance Review
    purpose: Identify bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
    prompt: |
      Analyze the code for performance characteristics and efficiency.
      
      Look for:
      - Algorithmic inefficiencies (time/space complexity)
      - Memory usage patterns and potential leaks
      - Database query optimization opportunities
      - Network I/O and concurrency issues
      - Unnecessary computations or redundant operations
      - Caching strategies and opportunities
      
      Recommendations should include:
      - Measurable performance impact estimates
      - Specific code modifications
      - Benchmarking suggestions where appropriate
      - Trade-off analysis between performance and maintainability
    severityThreshold: medium

  maintainability:
    name: Maintainability Review
    purpose: Assess code modularity and ease of modification
    prompt: |
      Evaluate the code's maintainability and long-term sustainability.
      
      Consider:
      - Code complexity and cognitive load
      - Module cohesion and separation of concerns
      - Dependency management and coupling
      - Documentation completeness and accuracy
      - Testability and ability to add tests
      - Extensibility for future requirements
      
      Feedback should include:
      - Refactoring suggestions with specific approaches
      - Architectural improvements
      - Areas that need additional documentation
      - Recommendations for improving test coverage
    severityThreshold: medium
